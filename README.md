# Voidcast

The Voidcast journal gives me a way to cast my thoughts into the void, digitally.

This started as [a thought about building simply](https://bsky.app/profile/robertgroves.com/post/3lfyfduxyr22x), let's see where it leads.

To avoid over-optimizing on simplicityâ€”[see this note on that](https://bsky.app/profile/robertgroves.com/post/3lfyifie2nk2i)â€”I'll outline a set of minimal requirements below.

# Requirements

## 2025-01-17 - Initial Minimal Requirements

- [x] I should be the only one able to create a journal entry.
- [x] I should be able to quickly add a text-only journal entry via a simple web-based UI.
- [x] All journal entries are to be publicly visible.

## 2025-01-19 - Requirements Round 2

- [x] Implement Post/Redirect/Get pattern to avoid resubmitting form on refresh of post page.
- [x] List entries in reverse chronological order.
- [x] I should be able to easily navigate back to the void page after creating an entry.
- [x] Make main Void Journal page and form look better.

# Dev Notes

## 2025-01-17 - Getting from 0 to deploy

I'm going to add a simple html file and get things configured so that when I commit to the repo it also deploys my code up to the web server. To meet this goal, I do need to figure out where I'm hosting this and how I deploy... all while keeping it simple.

### Hosting: A slight complication this way comes

My website [robertgroves.com](https://robertgroves.com) uses the Astro framework and is hosted up on Netlify. It isn't much right now, just has some Linkitty Links (my take on a linkinbio/linktree) up on it. I could have continued to use that to implement this Voidcast Journal, but that wouldn't have met [the challenge I laid out for myself](https://bsky.app/profile/robertgroves.com/post/3lfyfduxyr22x)â€”building simply from scratch. So I decided to just use a sub-domain, [void.robertgroves.com](https://void.robertgroves.com/), for this temporarily, instead of getting yet-another-domain-nameâ„¢. To avoid getting another web hosting account I'm using a different shared hosting account I've had for a very long time that I just use for throwing various random acts of digital ðŸ’© up on from time to time. I guess it could be considered cheating since this doesn't technically qualify as from scratch, but I'll make an exception here for two reasons:

1. I'm not using any pre-existing framework/structure that exists up on that shared hosting server; I've configured an NS and A record on Netlify so that [void.robertgroves.com](https://void.robertgroves.com/) hits a newly created sub-domain on the shared hosting server. This effectively gives me a clean slate to work on.
2. I'm making up the rules as I go and you can't stop me. ðŸ˜‰ (though I am trying to stay true to the spirit of the challenge)

### 2025-01-18 - Deploying

Originally I thought to use a GitHub Action to deploy the code to the web server, but I've decided to go simpler for now, so I'm creating a small deploy script that just performs a secure copy of the files to the web host from my local machine. Pro: I don't have to evaluate or create and configure a GitHub Action that can securely perform the transfer. Con: I'll need discipline to remember to deploy and only after committing the code (so the deployed state is always represented under version control).

I just realized I'm on a new laptop that has never connected via ssh to the web server I'm using so a slight detour was taken to generate a new ssh key and configure it on the server. Ran an scp test just to be sure things were working as expected and deploying is now good to go.

### 2025-01-19 - Rough Patches Showing After Initial Minimal Requirements Implementation

After using the initial implementation for a bit some rough patches are immediately apparent.

1. The appearance of the post form and the main void page have a lot of room for improvement.
2. After posting if the page is refreshed, the double POST problem is present.
3. After posting, the option to navigate to the main page should be there.
4. It's probably better to have the entries in reverse-chronological order.

### 2025-01-19 - Development Server

I was developing on my live server to start, but now that minimal functionality is in place and it's being used it feels kind of icky (even if it is just me using it). So I'm going to add a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to develop and test locally in a container before deploying changes to the live server.

## Metrics snapshot

I think it will be good to track some metrics as I continue to use this. I expect to use these to determine when this outgrows the limitations of the initial implementation.

### 2025-01-19 Snapshot

- 10 total Void Journal entries
- 3.8K Void Journal file size on server
- 5.5 kB transferred
- 5.3 kB resources
- Finish: 276 ms
- DOMContentLoaded: 281 ms
